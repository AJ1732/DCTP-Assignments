# DTCP Coding Assignments Repository
A repository for DTCP Assignments
This repository contains a collection of coding assignments that I completed as part of various courses and self-study. Each assignment is organized into its own folder, and you can find the code, instructions, and any additional resources related to each assignment within these folders.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AJ1732/DTCP-assignments.git
